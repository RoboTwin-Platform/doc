<img src="50-tasks.gif" alt="description" style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 100%;">

This document introduces the 50 bimanual manipulation tasks in RoboTwin 2.0, including task videos, descriptions, average step lengths, involved objects, and success rates across different robot embodiments.

Building on our automated task generation framework, embodiment-adaptive behavior synthesis, and the large-scale object asset library RoboTwin-OD, we construct a suite of over 50 dual-arm collaborative manipulation tasks. In addition, we support data collection and evaluation across 5 distinct robot platforms, enabling comprehensive benchmarking of manipulation policies. The complete task set is available at <a href="http://robotwin-platform.github.io/doc/tasks/">http://robotwin-platform.github.io/doc/tasks/</a>.
